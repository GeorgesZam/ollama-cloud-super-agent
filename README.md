# **Ollama Cloud Super Agent**

---

## **Hello and welcome to my Ollama Super Agent project**

---

### **Ollama has just released their cloud feature**, allowing you to access large models such as **Kimi-K2**, **DeepSeek**, **Qwen**, **GPT-OSS-20B**, and **GPT-OSS-120B**.

This is my personal workstation based on **Streamlit** and the **Ollama library**.  
It lets you, with no-code or low-code, create **agents** (function calling), **RAG systems**, **automations**, **web search tools**, **codex-like assistants**, and **MCP integrations**.

## **Concept**

**ASAP (Agent System Automation Platform)** is a place where you can create your own environment.  
You can build with **code**, **low-code**, or **no-code**.

When you ask to create an agent to automate a task you’re working on, click **"Copy what I'm doing"**.  
At that moment, the model will observe everything you’re working on — typing in a Word document, editing an Excel sheet, browsing the web, etc.

When you have completed your task, click **"Stop"**.  
If the model does not understand the purpose of your actions, it will ask questions to clarify.  
Once the model correctly understands your workflow, you can click **"Manage and Run"** to supervise it,  
or click **"Run"** directly if you think it doesn’t need human approval to complete the task.

## **Architecture**

Ollama is **compatible with the OpenAI API**, so the project is organized into multiple branches:

- [x] **Ollama branch** — free to use with Ollama Cloud or your personal laptop/server  
- [ ] **OpenAI API branch**  
- [ ] **Azure OpenAI branch** — for companies and enterprise setups  

Each branch will have two versions:
- **Tkinter** — for desktop applications  
- **Streamlit** — to easily share your project on the web or your own server
